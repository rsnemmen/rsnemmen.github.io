The ability to operationalize a machine-learning model is just as important as the
model itself. In <a href="https://rsnemmen.github.io/projects/2_deploy/">this project</a> I demonstrate how a trained XGBoost classifier is (1) served via an API with FastAPI and (2) containerized with Docker and (3) deployed to Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run).
