I gave the Data Seminar at the [National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)](https://www.nersc.gov) at [LBL](https://www.lbl.gov). My first time there. What a beautiful center, what powerful high-performance computing infrastructure. And what a view of the Bay Area!

I presented my group's work on applying different machine learning methods to advance our understanding of black holes, including black hole weather forecasting with AI. I am particularly excited about the transformative potential of neural operators for fluid dynamics, and its repercussions for black hole studies.

There were several interesting discussions on the similarities between Earth weather and black hole weather (very little, but there is some common physics), on neural operators, and ideas for follow-up studies with the data team. The talk is now available on Youtube.

After the talk, I visited the Perlmutter GPU cluster, which is surprisingly silent. Thanks, liquid cooling. And met by chance over lunch the legend Fernando Perez, creator of Jupyter.

Many thanks to Steve Farrell for being such a wonderful host.
