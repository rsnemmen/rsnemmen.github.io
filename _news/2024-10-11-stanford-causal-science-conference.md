Stanford hosted the [2024 Causal Science Conference](https://datascience.stanford.edu/causal/2024-causal-science-center-conference), and I was there to check it out. I am causal-curious. In my opinion, causal inference is one of the hottest and honestly seems to be one of the least explored topics in statistics these days. Given its importance, I wonder how folks in astronomy and physics have not been paying more attention to the field: *I was the only practicing (astro)physicist there!*. As a bonus, experts in this field are highly sought-after in the industry.

There were 50-70 people attending the conference. Mostly presentations by graduate students and postdocs with fascinating work. One [Nobel Prize winner in economics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2021/imbens/facts/) (which was casually pointed out to me by Juraj Bodik). 

My take as an outsider: the subject is actually interesting, with a solid theoretical foundation. There were 16 solid technical talks with none of the hype typical of ML events. I got so interested that I used the opportunity to ask folks there for a bibliography to get started in the field. I also started a Coursera on causal inference. Excited to learn more!
