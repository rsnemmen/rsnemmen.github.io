I gave a colloquium at the 2025 edition of the [Fundamental Physics School](https://www.sbfisica.org.br/v1/sbf/fundamental-physics-school-2025-feg-unesp/) at UNESP, Guaratinguetá. The organizers gave me complete freedom to talk about whatever I wanted, so I decided to present our work on operator learning for astrophysics with the catchy title: "Hawking meets Hinton".

Lots of good questions from the mostly graduate students (with a heavy theoretical physics flavor) attending the event. I will eventually post the slides here.
