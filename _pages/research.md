My field of research is black hole astrophysics: where *physics*, *astronomy*, *statistics* and *high-performance computing* collide. Out of this collision, I hope to get profound insights about the nature of gravity and the role of black holes in the cosmos. 

I work at the interface between theory and observations, employing advanced computational simulations to model black hole accretion and their outflows, and studying their observed electromagnetic-ray emission.

I use many tools in my research: 

- Scientific computing
- Statistical analysis
- High-performance computing and fluid dynamics simulations on GPUs
- Machine learning and predictive models
