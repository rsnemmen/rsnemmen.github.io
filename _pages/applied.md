## AREAS OF EXPERTISE

* **Forecasting & Predictive Modeling:** Specialized in simulating and predicting the behavior of complex, nonlinear systems using traditional (ARIMA, XGBoost, RNN) and innovative AI-driven approaches that combine neural operators and physical modeling.
* **Uncertainty Modeling:** Skilled in Bayesian inference, bootstrapping, quantile regression, and censored data techniques to ensure robust risk assessment and probabilistic forecasting in high-stakes environments.
* **Advanced Machine Learning & Data Analysis:** Proficient in deep neural networks, transformers, and physical neural networks, with extensive practical expertise in Python and CUDA—optimizing models for speed and accuracy.
* **High-Performance Computing & Simulation:** Extensive experience with GPU-accelerated computing (CUDA/MPI) to reduce simulation times significantly, which is directly applicable to real-time forecasting and large-scale quantitative analyses.
* **Quantitative Research & Mathematical Modeling:** Deep background in advanced mathematics to formulate robust models that capture the dynamics of chaotic systems, an expertise that transfers well to quantitative finance and risk management.

## SELECTED PROJECTS

* **AI-Driven Forecasting Algorithms:** Developed a PyTorch-based forecasting algorithm using neural operators to accelerate simulations (up to 25x faster), showcasing techniques that can be tailored to forecast hard-to-predict systems.
* **GPU-Accelerated Simulations:** Pioneered GPU solvers using CUDA to reduce simulation runtimes by 3x in complex environments, demonstrating the capability to take advanced simulation techniques from research and deploy them efficiently in high-performance financial modeling and uncertainty quantification.
* **High-Performance Bayesian Inference Engine:** Combined [deep learning with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.5657A/abstract) to swiftly generate and fit models that can be directly translated into probabilistic forecasting and risk management.
* **Uncertainty Quantification in Limited Information Environments:** Developed [regression techniques for censored, sparsely sampled data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.4120D/abstract) and [applied bootstrapping](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.2934R/abstract) to robustly quantify prediction uncertainty.
* **Feature Selection from High-Dimensional Data:** Led [research published in *Science*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Sci...338.1445N/abstract) that distilled dozens of variables into two key predictors, isolating the core drivers of system behavior—a crucial capability for alpha generation in quantitative finance.
