As an astrophysicist, I've spent 14 years unraveling the mysteries of black holes and decoding complex astronomical phenomena. My journey has taken me from **NASA** to **Stanford** and **University of Sao Paulo (USP)**, where I've honed my skills in problem solving, computational models and scientific data exploration (satellite-based). At USP, I've had the privilege of leading diverse teams and mentoring the next generation of scientists. 

My work has been featured in *BBC, NASA, Science, Ars Technica*, and on *Fant√°stico* and *Jornal Nacional*, Brazil's two most-watched news programs. These experiences have allowed me to communicate complex scientific ideas to a global audience and reflect the broader impact of my research.

Now, I am applying my expertise to advance predictive modeling and use machine learning algorithms in novel applications. My goal is to continue bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical solutions, harnessing the power of data and AI to shape our understanding of the universe and our world. I am excited to explore new frontiers where my unique blend of scientific insight and technical skills can make a significant impact.

In my free time, I read, write and ride motorcycles. I once represented my home state in a disk throwing competition, and, ironically, ended up researching gas disks around black holes.
