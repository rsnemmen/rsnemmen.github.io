N&amp;V articles explain the results of new research paper in a way that is accessible to a broad community of scientists outside the specific field, while giving the author’s opinion on the work. LRDs are the hottest thing in astronomy right now, and nobody really knows their nature (no pun intended). As you will learn in <a href="https://rdcu.be/eY4PS" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">my N&amp;V piece</a>, the astronomical community is converging on a “hey, actually they are growing massive black holes” kind of model.</p> <p>I hope you enjoy my article.</p> <h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2> <p>It can be tricky writing to a broad community of scientists. I would like to thank the following colleagues who gave me feedback on the first draft of the N&amp;V piece: Rafael de Souza (fast responder!), Paula Coelho, Matt Luzum, Gastão Lima Neto, Nina Hirata, Thaisa Storchi Bergmann, Rafael Ribeiro and Raniere de Menezes.</p> </body></html>
