<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I was invited to give a review talk about relativistic jets from AGN in the <a href="https://zihuagn.irya.unam.mx" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">”AGN redemption" conference</a>. The venue was at beautiful, humid Zihuatanejo. I haven't been in such a excruciatingly hot place since I lived in Porto Alegre, or when I visited Rio during summer. So if you are wondering if Zihuatanejo is warm at the end of October: yes sir! Very much so.</p> <p>Anyway, the organizers asked me to give a comprehensive overview (30 minutes) of "jet formation and evolution". The theme of the conference was the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_shawshank" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shawshank Redemption</a> movie, because this is the place where the movie ends (if you haven't watched the movie, go stream it). So the organizers made a big deal about it. They asked the presenters to mention their favorite movie at the end of each talk. Most of them did, but I chose not to because I did not have 1 minute to spare in my review talk (reviewing the entire field of AGN jets in 30 minutes is no easy task, it turns out).</p> <p>I decided to pick about ten papers in the field that caught my attention in the last 2-3 years, and focused on those papers and why they are relevant. And I strictly concentrated on formation, dynamics/kinematics and the status of the radio-loud/radio-quiet division. The slides are <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30899891" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">available here</a>. For future reference, the talk was given on October 31st 2025.</p> <p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/nemmen/03pm.webp" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-16 at 8"></p> <p>By the way, I should point out a correction to the slide 27 about the second M87* ring: even though I wrote in the slide that it was observed by EHT, it was actually seen by ALMA+GLT+GMVA. My bad.</p> </body></html>
